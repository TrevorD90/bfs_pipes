# bfs_pipes
This was a coding challenge given to me during one of my interviews. I had never coded in Python before so I had to learn while doing the project. I did not use AI for this except to ask simple questions on how Python itself worked. I, however, wrote the code.

In order to run this project down load the main python file and open it in an IDE that can use Python. Use the text script in the file called: "coding_qual_input". Get the file path of the text document and put that in the file_path variable at the bottom. Run the program.
